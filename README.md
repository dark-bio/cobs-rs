This repository is a *fast* implementation of [Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing). It doesn't do much, but it does it fast. Although there might be eventual fixups and feature expansions for streaming codecs, assume the library is "done".
